Days completed: **`10`** / **`25`**

View the `src` folder for my `c++` puzzle solutions thus far.

> ***The following may require a UNIX / LINUX enviornment.***

```
git clone https://github.com/VyProductions/AdventofCode2022
```

Within each `Puzzle*` directory (ie, `src/D1/Puzzle1/`), use
```
make
```
to compile, build, and run the two puzzle solutions.

> **Note: `make` command may require installation.**
